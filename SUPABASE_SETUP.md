# ðŸš€ **Supabase Setup Guide for Love Story Website**

## **Step 1: Create Supabase Project**

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)

   - **Database Password**: Create a strong password (save it!)
   - **Region**: Choose closest to your users
6. Click "Create new project"

   ```bash
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-url.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
   ```

2. **Important**: Never commit `.env` to git! Add it to `.gitignore`

## **Step 4: Create Database Schema**

1. In Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Copy the entire content from `supabase-schema.sql`
3. Paste it in the SQL editor

3. Try uploading an image
4. Check the browser console for any errors

   - Check if storage bucket was created

   - Check if files were uploaded to storage
   - Verify bucket is public
   - Check browser console for errors

### **Debug Steps:**

3. Check Supabase dashboard for failed requests
4. Verify environment variables are loaded
